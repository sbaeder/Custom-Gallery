make BFM's multiple product page formatting be a plug-in


*  NOTES - 3/26/15
This relies on all the other things BFM added to the EQL DB (using acf from the original theme).
It appears that the 5 link version is broken, and I (Scott) heavily modified the display of the 
short-code so that this would at least do something for all the older versions created.

This content and plug-in should be phased out...
